Just a simple little hack to grab code snippets from Stack Overflow. Going to be used to see what I can build using just code from SO.

Requires:
CodeMirror: Javascript library used for editing component (should be placed in the static directory)
Tornado: Python web server
BeautifulSoup: Python web scraper
